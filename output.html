/*
Removes the annoying .1px border (apparently rendered as 1px) from
Draft.js element. This prevents us from centering text properly.
The only explanation for that border in draft-js
code is that it helps to "Repair mysterious missing Safari cursor".
While in Infogram and Prezi Design nothing seems to be disappearing,
we can speculate that this is a workaround for some cases where content
needed to be offset by a little bit so that cursor is visible. In TEXT
elements we do this by adding 2px margins for each text element on both
sides while editing
